Project Name: Game system requirements fetcher

Description:
	
	Language:php
	
	Enter any game name, the API gives the minimum hardware+software requirement to play the game on a PC/laptop.
	The API autocorrects the game name entered if applicable,for instance, CS GO is changed to Counter Strike Global Offensive.This 
	feature is required as the API fetches data from internet where games are not named in short forms.Also if user makes a minor 
	spelling mistake while entering the game name, still he is good to go.
		
	IMPORTANT NOTE: THE API REQUIRES AT MAX 60 SECONDS (ON AN AVERAGE 5 TO 10 SECONDS) TO WORK AS IT FETCHES HUGE DATA FROM 			INTERNET(net is slow @IITG) PLEASE BE PATIENT TILL RESULT IS DISPLAYED.
